# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction-Applied-Machine-Learning
This report aims to explore the hotel industry in developing effective pricing strategies by predicting hotel booking cancellations. The data used for analysis was obtained from the Kaggle (Mostipak, 2020). It employed a comprehensive approach, utilising thirteen distinct machine learning and deep learning models to predict hotel booking cancellations as a classification problem.
Through our analysis, we observed that most of our models achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 80%. The Random Forest Classifier model exhibited the highest accuracy rate of 87.63% on this dataset. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that each model applied distinct methodologies in processing the dataset, potentially influencing the outcomes in terms of the accuracy rate.
By leveraging these predictive models, hotel operators can anticipate booking demand more accurately, optimising pricing decisions and enhancing revenue management.
